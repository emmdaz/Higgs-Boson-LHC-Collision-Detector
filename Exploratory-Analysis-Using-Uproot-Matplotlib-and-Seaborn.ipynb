    "The standard library to read and write ROOT files in Python is the well (or not) know ROOT library but sometimes it can be difficult to understand or at least I had this promblem when doing it. \n",

    "\n",
    "It has the advantage that it is an I/O library (Input/Output library) which means it's primarly designed to handle data reading and writting and its vision is focused to take the data from the ROOT files for machine learning libraries in Pyhton. \n",

    "\n",
    "From the ROOT primer you'll see that:\n",
    "\"ROOT is a software framework for data analysis and I/O: a powerful tool to cope with the demanding task typicial of state of the art scientific data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROOT is better known for being the software used to store the data of most Large Hadron Collider experiments. But it actually has other features such as its advanced graphical user interface used for analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "ROOT is an open source project coordinated by the Euroepan Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN in Geneva. It was created in order to satisfice the necessity of a tool to visualice data, to make some manipulations on it, to have a powrful library of mathematical functions and procedures, to visualice the uncertainties of experiments, to do data analysis with the collected data, to analize a large data volume, to have and easy-to-use and efficient methods for storing and handling data, to generate and visualize frequency distributions, to simulate data (generation of pseudo-data) inter alia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many ROOT functions are desingned in C++, so a little knowledge about this language is needed. Although it has its equivalent in python, so one should be able to work with the ROOT library and it is very similar to the C++ workflow. \n",

    "\n",
    "Delphes is a C++ basic framework for sumulations of generic collider experiments. It is fast and multipurpose for detector response simulation which includes a tracking system, embedded into a magnetic field, calorimeters and a muon system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Delphes framework is based in standard file formats such as Les Houches Event File (a standard in event generators to define event listings in a common language) and HepMC, and outputs observables that can be used for analyses. The simulations tackes into account things as the effect of magnetic field among others. \n",
    "\n",
    "The visualization of the final state particles is built-in using the ROOT library. The output can be analyzed using the ROOT data analysis framework or alternatively using Uproot (which will be done in this work). In most cases it can be done with TTree draw or with ROOT macros.\n",
